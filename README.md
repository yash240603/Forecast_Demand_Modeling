# Forecast Demand Modelling System

The **Forecast Demand Modelling System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict and analyze demand trends. Built during the Summer University 2024 program at Ural Federal University, this project was developed for 1C Enterprises and was awarded the Best Project in the IT track. The system uses time series analysis to generate accurate demand forecasts, helping businesses optimize inventory and meet customer needs effectively.

## Features

- **Demand Forecasting**: Leverages machine learning algorithms and time series analysis to predict future demand trends.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Integrates diverse user databases for personalized demand forecasting.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations for easy understanding of demand patterns.
- **Efficient Integration**: Designed for seamless integration with existing enterprise systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- **Version Control**: Git

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features from historical data to improve prediction accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms to train models on historical demand data.
4. **Demand Prediction**: Provides forecasts based on trained models.
5. **Visualization**: Displays results using user-friendly charts and graphs.
